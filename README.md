# unlocked.sh
<hr>

Ever stumbled upon a friend/colleagues computer that was left unlocked?    
You get tempted to mess with them but don't have enough time to type <i>all</i> those commands.    
Introducing the `unlocked.sh` script designed to simplify this process.    
This script is available online at `unlocked.agrim.io` .

### Usage
```bash
# DO NOT RUN THIS ON YOUR OWN COMPUTER !!
curl unlocked.agrim.io | bash
```

#### General Contribution Guidelines
- Don't be a jerk, no adding any `sudo rm -rf` commands.
- Don't compromise security, no messing with anything in `~/.ssh` or `~/.aws` etc.
- No using links to any domains in the script.
- The script is generally MacOS centric.
- The point is to make it funny such as `alias vim='emacs'`
